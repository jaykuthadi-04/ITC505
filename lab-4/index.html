    <h3>SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace.</h3>

    <p><blockquote><i>Enter GONERIL and EDMUND</i></blockquote></p>

    <p><b>GONERIL</b><blockquote>Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband<br>Not met us on the way.<br><i>Enter OSWALD</i><br>Now, where's your master?</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>OSWALD</b><blockquote>Madam, within; but never man so changed.<br>I told him of the army that was landed;<br>He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:<br>His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,<br>And of the loyal service of his son,<br>When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,<br>And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:<br>What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;<br>What like, offensive.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>GONERIL</b><blockquote>[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.<br>It is the cowish terror of his spirit,<br>That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs<br>Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way<br>May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;<br>Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:<br>I must change arms at home, and give the distaff<br>Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant<br>Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,<br>If you dare venture in your own behalf,<br>A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;<br><i>Giving a favour</i><br>Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,<br>Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:<br>Conceive, and fare thee well.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>EDMUND</b><blockquote>Yours in the ranks of death.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>GONERIL</b><blockquote>My most dear Gloucester!<br><i>Exit EDMUND</i><br>O, the difference of man and man!<br>To thee a woman's services are due:<br>My fool usurps my body.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>OSWALD</b><blockquote>Madam, here comes my lord.<br><i>Exit</i><br><i>Enter ALBANY</i></blockquote></p>

    <p><b>GONERIL</b><blockquote>I have been worth the whistle.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>O Goneril!<br>You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br>Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:<br>That nature, which contemns its origin,<br>Cannot be border'd certain in itself;<br>She that herself will sliver and disbranch<br>From her material sap, perforce must wither<br>And come to deadly use.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>GONERIL</b><blockquote>No more; the text is foolish.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:<br>Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?<br>Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?<br>A father, and a gracious aged man,<br>Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,<br>Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.<br>Could my good brother suffer you to do it?<br>A man, a prince, by him so benefited!<br>If that the heavens do not their visible spirits<br>Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,<br>It will come,<br>Humanity must perforce prey on itself,<br>Like monsters of the deep.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>GONERIL</b><blockquote>Milk-liver'd man!<br>That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;<br>Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning<br>Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st<br>Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd<br>Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?<br>France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;<br>With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;<br>Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest<br>'Alack, why does he so?'</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>See thyself, devil!<br>Proper deformity seems not in the fiend<br>So horrid as in woman.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>GONERIL</b><blockquote>O vain fool!</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,<br>Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness<br>To let these hands obey my blood,<br>They are apt enough to dislocate and tear<br>Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,<br>A woman's shape doth shield thee.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>GONERIL</b><blockquote>Marry, your manhood now--<br><i>Enter a Messenger</i></blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>What news?</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>Messenger</b><blockquote>O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:<br>Slain by his servant, going to put out<br>The other eye of Gloucester.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>Gloucester's eye!</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>Messenger</b><blockquote>A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,<br>Opposed against the act, bending his sword<br>To his great master; who, thereat enraged,<br>Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;<br>But not without that harmful stroke, which since<br>Hath pluck'd him after.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>This shows you are above,<br>You justicers, that these our nether crimes<br>So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!<br>Lost he his other eye?</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>Messenger</b><blockquote>Both, both, my lord.<br>This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;<br>'Tis from your sister.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>GONERIL</b><blockquote>[Aside] One way I like this well;<br>But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,<br>May all the building in my fancy pluck<br>Upon my hateful life: another way,<br>The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.<br><i>Exit</i></blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>Where was his son when they did take his eyes?</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>Messenger</b><blockquote>Come with my lady hither.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>He is not here.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>Messenger</b><blockquote>No, my good lord; I met him back again.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>Knows he the wickedness?</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>Messenger</b><blockquote>Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;<br>And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment<br>Might have the freer course.</blockquote></p>

    <p><b>ALBANY</b><blockquote>Gloucester, I live<br>To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,<br>And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:<br>Tell me what more thou know'st.<br><i>Exeunt</i></blockquote></p>
