    <blockquote style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; border-left: 4px solid #999; padding-left: 20px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
        FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded<br>
        A plaintful story from a sistering vale,<br>
        My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,<br>
        And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;<br>
        Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,<br>
        Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,<br>
        Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.<br>

        Upon her head a platted hive of straw,<br>
        Which fortified her visage from the sun,<br>
        Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw<br>
        The carcass of beauty spent and done:<br>
        Time had not scythed all that youth begun,<br>
        Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,<br>
        Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.<br>

        Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,<br>
        Which on it had conceited characters,<br>
        Laundering the silken figures in the brine<br>
        That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,<br>
        And often reading what contents it bears;<br>
        As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,<br>
        In clamours of all size, both high and low.<br>

        Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,<br>
        As they did battery to the spheres intend;<br>
        Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied<br>
        To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend<br>
        Their view right on; anon their gazes lend<br>
        To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,<br>
        The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.<br>

        Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,<br>
        Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride:<br>
        For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,<br>
        Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;<br>
        Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,<br>
        And true to bondage would not break from thence,<br>
        Though slackly braided in loose negligence.<br>

        A thousand favours from a maund she drew<br>
        Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,<br>
        Which one by one she in a river threw,<br>
        Upon whose weeping margent she was set;<br>
        Like usury, applying wet to wet,<br>
        Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall<br>
        Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.<br>

        Of folded schedules had she many a one,<br>
        Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;<br>
        Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone<br>
        Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;<br>
        Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,<br>
        With sleided silk feat and affectedly<br>
        Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.<br>

        These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,<br>
        And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:<br>
        Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,<br>
        What unapproved witness dost thou bear!<br>
        Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'<br>
        This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,<br>
        Big discontent so breaking their contents.<br>
