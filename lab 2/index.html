<h3>SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter GONERIL and EDMUND</i>
</blockquote>

<b>GONERIL</b>
<blockquote>
Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband<br>
Not met us on the way.<br>
<p><i>Enter OSWALD</i></p>
Now, where's your master?<br>
</blockquote>

<b>OSWALD</b>
<blockquote>
Madam, within; but never man so changed.<br>
I told him of the army that was landed;<br>
He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:<br>
His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,<br>
And of the loyal service of his son,<br>
When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,<br>
And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:<br>
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;<br>
What like, offensive.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>GONERIL</b>
<blockquote>
[To EDMUND] Then shall you go no further.<br>
It is the cowish terror of his spirit,<br>
That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs<br>
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way<br>
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;<br>
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:<br>
I must change arms at home, and give the distaff<br>
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant<br>
Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,<br>
If you dare venture in your own behalf,<br>
A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;<br>
<p><i>Giving a favour</i></p>
Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,<br>
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:<br>
Conceive, and fare thee well.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>EDMUND</b>
<blockquote>
Yours in the ranks of death.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>GONERIL</b>
<blockquote>
My most dear Gloucester!<br>
<p><i>Exit EDMUND</i></p>
O, the difference of man and man!<br>
To thee a woman's services are due:<br>
My fool usurps my body.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>OSWALD</b>
<blockquote>
Madam, here comes my lord.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
<p><i>Enter ALBANY</i></p>
</blockquote>

<b>GONERIL</b>
<blockquote>
I have been worth the whistle.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
O Goneril!<br>
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br>
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:<br>
That nature, which contemns its origin,<br>
Cannot be border'd certain in itself;<br>
She that herself will sliver and disbranch<br>
From her material sap, perforce must wither<br>
And come to deadly use.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>GONERIL</b>
<blockquote>
No more; the text is foolish.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:<br>
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?<br>
Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?<br>
A father, and a gracious aged man,<br>
Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,<br>
Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.<br>
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?<br>
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!<br>
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits<br>
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,<br>
It will come,<br>
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,<br>
Like monsters of the deep.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>GONERIL</b>
<blockquote>
Milk-liver'd man!<br>
That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;<br>
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning<br>
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st<br>
Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd<br>
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?<br>
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;<br>
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;<br>
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest<br>
'Alack, why does he so?'<br>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
See thyself, devil!<br>
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend<br>
So horrid as in woman.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>GONERIL</b>
<blockquote>
O vain fool!<br>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,<br>
Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness<br>
To let these hands obey my blood,<br>
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear<br>
Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,<br>
A woman's shape doth shield thee.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>GONERIL</b>
<blockquote>
Marry, your manhood now!--<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Enter a Messenger</b>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
What news?<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Messenger</b>
<blockquote>
O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:<br>
Slain by his servant, going to put out<br>
The other eye of Gloucester.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
Gloucester's eyes!<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Messenger</b>
<blockquote>
A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,<br>
Opposed against the act, bending his sword<br>
To his great master; who, thereat enraged,<br>
Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;<br>
But not without that harmful stroke, which since<br>
Hath pluck'd him after.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
This shows you are above,<br>
You justicers, that these our nether crimes<br>
So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!<br>
Lost he his other eye?<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Messenger</b>
<blockquote>
Both, both, my lord.<br>
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;<br>
'Tis from your sister.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>GONERIL</b>
<blockquote>
[Aside] One way I like this well;<br>
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,<br>
May all the building in my fancy pluck<br>
Upon my hateful life: another way,<br>
The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.<br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Messenger</b>
<blockquote>
Come with my lady hither.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
He is not here.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Messenger</b>
<blockquote>
No, my good lord; I met him back again.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
Knows he the wickedness?<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Messenger</b>
<blockquote>
Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;<br>
And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment<br>
Might have the freer course.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>ALBANY</b>
<blockquote>
Gloucester, I live<br>
To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,<br>
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:<br>
Tell me what more thou know'st.<br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
</blockquote>
